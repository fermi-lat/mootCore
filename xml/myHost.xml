<!-- sample file describing how to connect to dbs associated with
     a MOOT archive.  This one is appropriate for the archive 
     (primary, not mirror) associated with the master mood_test dbs.

     The attribute 'write' defaults to "false". It should only be set
     to 'true' if this is the primary (not mirror) archive for the
     database.

     <connection> has an attribute 'port' whose value defaults to "0".

     If the archive is a mirror, it may also specify an alternate host
     with an element <slave> whose structure is identical to <master>
