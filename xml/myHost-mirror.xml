<!-- sample file describing how to connect to dbs associated with
     a MOOT archive.  This one is a template for a mirror archive.

     Here host and port are set for the databases served by
     glastlnx06, mirrored at lat-dmz0,  and database is mood_test.  
     Because of the use of ssh tunneling, both master and slave
     host appear to be lat-dmz0.

     For the mood_user database set dbname="mood_user" and
     nickname="u2_"

     For the production database set dbname="mood" and
     nickname="prod_"

     The attribute 'write' defaults to "false".  That's appropriate
     for a mirror so it's omitted here

     The default for the port attribute of <master> and <slave> is "0".
