  @section intro Introduction
  This package contains classes and interfaces providing configuration
  tracking services (aid in building, registering with fmx, queries, etc.) 
  to online users, such as LICOS.   

  A separate package, fully integrated into GLAST Offline, will provide
  the subset of those services of interest to offline analysis.
